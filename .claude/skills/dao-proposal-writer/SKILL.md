name: dao-proposal-writer
description: Write and tighten DAO governance proposals to the professional standard of pre-2023 forum proposals (Uniswap, ENS, Arbitrum, Aave, Compound, 1inch, Optimism, Maker), using the target DAO's own template and with no AI padding — no restating, no self-verification, no leftovers from earlier drafts or chats. Use this whenever a DAOplomats member wants to draft, rewrite, shorten, clean up or format a governance proposal, temp check, RFC, AIP/EP/1IP/ARFC, grant or funding request, delegate program, parameter change, or a forum post to a DAO, even if they only paste notes, bullet points, an old draft or a call transcript. For critiquing someone else's proposal or deciding a vote, use governance-review instead.

# DAO proposal writer (DAOplomats standard)

Proposals that passed and aged well before the AI boom read like
engineering change requests: a one-line ask, the evidence, the exact
actions, the money, the dates. Nothing said twice. This skill produces
that, in the target DAO's own format.

The three failure modes this skill exists to prevent:

1. **Reaffirmation** — the summary restated in the motivation, sections that
   re-sell themselves, a closing recap.
2. **Reverification** — "verified", "double-checked", ✅, "to the best of our
   knowledge" in place of a link to the source.
3. **Context bleed** — chat residue ("here's the updated draft"), comparisons
   to earlier drafts the reader never saw, and stale facts carried over from
   old proposals or previous versions.

`references/anti-slop.md` explains each with before/after rewrites. Read it
the first time you use this skill in a conversation.

## Workflow

### 1. Pin down the target and the stage

You need: the DAO, the stage (idea / temp check / RFC / on-chain), and the
proposal type (funding, parameter change, contract upgrade, delegate or
council program, social/constitutional). Infer them from what the member
gave you; ask only for what you can't infer.

Then open `references/dao-templates.md` and use that DAO's headings, in its
order, with its title format and metadata. If the DAO isn't listed, use the
DAOplomats default skeleton below and tell the member to check the forum's
pinned template (most Discourse forums pin one in "Proposals" or "Governance").

### 2. Collect facts, not prose

Pull every fact out of the member's material into a working list: the ask,
amounts, recipient addresses, parameters (current → proposed), dates,
milestones, people/entities and their roles, prior votes and forum links,
data and its source.

Treat old drafts, prior proposals and transcripts as **source material**,
not as text to carry forward. For each fact, check it belongs to the
current version. If a number, date, address or name appears only in older
material, or two sources disagree, don't guess and don't silently pick one:
put it in an "Open questions" list for the member (step 5).

Never invent figures, addresses, endorsements, audit results or
precedents. Where a value is missing, leave a visible `[TBD: what is
needed]` marker so the draft can't be posted by accident.

### 3. Write each section once

Assign every fact to exactly one section (Summary is the only place a fact
may appear in brief). Then write:

- **Title**: the DAO's prefix format + a verb phrase naming the action and
  the scale. `[Temp Check] Deploy Uniswap v3 to Celo`, not
  `Proposal: An Exciting Opportunity for Growth`.
- **Summary / Abstract**: 1–3 sentences. What is being done, by whom, for
  how much, by when. Someone who reads only this knows what a "For" vote does.
- **Motivation**: the problem with evidence (numbers with sources, links to
  prior discussion). Start with the evidence, not a paraphrase of the summary.
- **Rationale** (where the template has it): the alternatives considered and
  why this one. Short. This is where objections are pre-empted, plainly.
- **Specification**: exact and checkable. Full addresses in code
  formatting with explorer links, parameter tables (current → proposed),
  calldata or a link to it, who executes, which multisig/timelock.
- **Budget / Cost**: a table: line, amount, basis. Token, chain, and the
  conversion date if USD-denominated. Vesting/streaming and clawback terms.
- **Timeline / Milestones / KPIs**: dated, measurable, tied to payments.
- **Vote options / Next steps**: what each option does, and the next stage.

Link prior forum threads and votes instead of re-summarising them. Name the
author's interests once, in a Disclosure line if the template has none
(DAOplomats is a delegate; if the author is compensated by, delegates for,
or is a recipient under this proposal, say so).

Style: short declarative sentences, active voice with named actors, "we"
for the authors, no emoji, no hype vocabulary, bold only for the amount and
the vote options. Write in the register of a technical memo.

### 4. Check the draft

Run the linter and fix every ERROR except open `[TBD]` placeholders (those
stay until the member supplies the value); fix WARNs unless you can say why
one is fine:

```bash
python3 <skill-dir>/scripts/slop_check.py draft.md --dao <uniswap|ens|arbitrum|1inch|aave|compound|optimism|generic>
```

Then the judgment pass the script can't do. For each, re-read the draft:

- Delete any sentence whose information already appeared earlier.
- Read the Summary alone. Does it say what a For vote does and costs?
- Every number and address: is it from the member's current inputs or a
  cited source, and does it match everywhere it's referenced?
- Anything comparing to "before", "previously", "now", "no longer": is the
  comparison against something the forum actually saw?
- Would cutting this paragraph lose a fact? If not, cut it.

Target length: most pre-2023 proposals that passed ran 400–1,200 words
before tables and code. Longer only when the specification needs it.

### 5. Hand it back

Give the member:

1. The proposal in Markdown, ready to paste into Discourse. Nothing above
   or below it inside the code/quote block.
2. Outside the proposal, a short **Open questions** list: every `[TBD]`,
   every conflict between sources, every fact you couldn't confirm for
   this version.
3. If they gave you an earlier version: a **Changes since vN** list they can
   post as a forum reply. This list never goes into the proposal body.

Don't append a recap of what you did or offers to adjust beyond one line.

## DAOplomats default skeleton

Use when the DAO has no template or the member asks for a generic one.

```markdown
# [Stage] Verb phrase naming the action and its scale

**Author:** DAOplomats (forum handle)  ·  **Date:** YYYY-MM-DD  ·  **Stage:** Temp Check | RFC | On-chain
**Related:** [prior thread](link), [prior vote](link)

## Summary
One to three sentences.

## Motivation
Problem and evidence, with sources.

## Rationale
Alternatives considered; why this one.

## Specification
Exact actions. Addresses, parameters (current → proposed), executor, calldata link.

## Budget
| Line | Amount | Basis |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ... | ... | ... |
| **Total** | **...** | |

## Timeline and milestones
| Milestone | Deliverable / KPI | Date | Payment |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

## Risks
Each risk and its mitigation, one line each. Omit if none are material.

## Disclosure
Authors' relevant interests.

## Vote options
- **For**: what happens.
- **Against**: what happens.
- **Abstain**
```

Drop sections that would be empty (e.g. Budget on a no-cost parameter
change becomes one line: "No cost to the treasury."). Don't add sections the
template doesn't have.

## Reference files

- `references/dao-templates.md` — per-DAO title formats, stages, headings and
  metadata, with links to the official templates and well-written pre-2023
  examples. Read the section for the target DAO.
- `references/anti-slop.md` — the three failure modes in detail, vocabulary
  table, formatting tells, before/after rewrites.
- `scripts/slop_check.py` — linter for the mechanical cases.
